        <h3 id="1-AA">2.What is GOOGLE CLOUD</h3>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028100940.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <P>Google Cloud Platform, or GCP, is a series of cloud computing services provided by Google. 
            In addition to providing management tools, Google Cloud Platform also provides a range of 
            modular cloud services, including: cloud computing, data storage, data analytics and machine 
            learning. In addition, users are required to provide credit card or bank account payment information 
            when registering an account.</P>
        <br>
        <h3 id="2-BB">3.How to use GOOGLE CLOUD</h3>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028100943.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>Introduced the three main functions of the console page.(Menu,Search Bar,Avatar)</p>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028100945.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>Some products provided by Google Cloud. Focus on how to create buckets, virtual machines and databases.</p>
        <p>Scrolling down the console page, you'll see that the term "Product" refers to the various services and 
            tools offered by Google Cloud, such as virtual machines, databases, and storage buckets.
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028100947.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>Explains how to use buckets to store files in Google Cloud.</p>
        <p>The simplest example is that we can use Google Cloud to store our files. After logging into our 
            Google account and linking a credit card, we can create a bucket, and then we can upload files 
            to it. Once the upload is successful, we can download the files back from Google Cloud.
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028100948.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>Steps to create a virtual machine on Google Cloud. The configuration of the virtual machine 
            can be customized according to personal needs.</p>
        <p>Click "Create Instance" in "Compute Engine" to create a virtual machine. During the creation 
            process, we can make the selection of functions such as instance naming, selection of region 
            and operating system. For example, we can choose the most familiar Ubuntu operating system in 
            the Boot disk. After we complete the setup, click the "Create" button to obtain a virtual machine. 
            Then we can use SSH-in-browser to access the command line interface of the virtual machine.
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028100950.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>Steps to create a database on Google Cloud. Similarly, the configuration of the database can be 
            customized according to personal needs.</p>
        <p>To create a database, we also need to click ＂Create Instance" in "SQL＂ first, then select the 
            database engine and versions. Finally, click "Create Instance＂again to create a database.
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028100952.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>The console page additionally provides "Developer Tools" and "Interactive Tutorials" to 
            help users better use and understand Google Cloud.</p>
        <p>"Interactive Tutorials" provides some guides to help users how to use Google Cloud. </p>
        <p>"Developer Tools" offer some practical tools, such as Cloud Shell and Cloud SDK, which can help you interact
            with resources or edit code online.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 id="3-CC">Usage scenarios of GOOGLE CLOUD</h3>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028100953.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>A small business wants to launch a professional website for their services. They need a fast, reliable platform 
            without having to manage all the technical infrastructure themselves. They use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to 
            easily develop, host, and manage the website.</p>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028100955.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>GCP's machine learning services include AI Platform and AutoML, which enable users to build, train, and deploy 
            machine learning models. Users can use the pre-trained models and tools provided by GCP to quickly realize functions 
            such as natural language processing and image recognition. With GCP, users can easily integrate machine learning 
            capabilities and improve the intelligence level of applications.</p>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028100957.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>

        <h3 id="4-DD">Advantages and disadvantages of GOOGLE CLOUD</h3>    
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028100958.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>GCP's billing model is based on pay-as-you-go, where users only pay for the resources they actually use. The 
            console provides expense management tools where users can view usage and expenses in real time, set budgets 
            and alerts to avoid overspending. Understanding the expense structure helps users optimize resource usage and 
            reduce cloud computing costs.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 id="5-EE">Code example</h3>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028101000.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <li>Command Line: Fast, simple, suitable for manual or small-scale operations.</li>
        <li>REST API: Flexible, programming interface for programmatic access and developer integration.</li>
        <li>Terraform: Repeatable, declarative configuration for large and complex deployments.</li>
        <p>Users can choose three suitable methods (Command Line, REST API, Terraform) to interact with and manage 
            Google Cloud.These three methods provide different levels of flexibility and control.</p>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028101003.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>To create a virtual machine, the four important components of the code are:</p>
        <li>Instance name</li>
        <li>The geographic region of the instance</li>
        <li>Network interface</li>
        <li>Create disk</li>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028101005.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>The graphical interface is more beginner-friendly, but the terminal has the advantage of 
            efficiency, flexibility, and control, especially when frequent operations or complex 
            configurations are required; thus, the command line is more efficient.</p>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028101008.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>To ensure network security, a firewall needs to be established for the VM. The four important code settings for the firewall are:</p>
        <li>"name": Specifies the name of the firewall rule</li>
        <li>"network" : Specifies the network to which the firewall rule applies</li>
        <li>"priority": Determines the priority of a firewall rule. A smaller number indicates a higher priority. The usual range is 0-65535.</li>
        <li>"allowed": Define the allowed traffic rules. The allowed protocol and port must be entered</li>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028101010.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>Each VM instance requires at least one boot disk, which contains the operating system. The three important components of the code 
            for creating a disk are:</p>
        <li>Create a persistent disk named disk-1 with a size of 100 GB.</li>
        <li>Create a daily snapshot schedule named default-schedule-1 to retain snapshots for a maximum of 14 days.</li>
        <li>Apply snapshot plans to disk-1 disks to ensure that snapshots are automatically generated and managed.</li>

        <h3>Hosting Applications Using Google Cloud Run</h3>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028101026.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>Cloud Run is a fully managed compute service from Google Cloud that allows users to easily 
            deploy and manage containerized applications. It supports a serverless architecture, where users 
            only need to focus on code and containers, and don't need to manage infrastructure. Cloud Run autoscales, 
            automatically adjusts resources based on traffic, supports services triggered by HTTP requests, 
            and works with a variety of programming languages and frameworks. It also provides seamless integration 
            with other Google Cloud services for scenarios such as building microservices, APIs, and background 
            processing tasks. This page also gives a brief overview of its pros and cons.</p>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028101028.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>For this aspect of the content, a simple application was made and hosted. It is simply divided into two parts, app making and hosting</p>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028101030.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>First, I created a Flask app that handles GET and POST requests. Next, I wrote a Dockerfile for 
            containerization and listed the dependencies in requirements.txt. Finally, I built and ran the Docker 
            container. With that initial work completed, we moved on to the important hosting phase.</p>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028101032.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>First, create a new project and a new folder, then copy the application files you previously completed 
            into that folder. Use the illustrated commands to build your Docker image and deploy your image to Cloud 
            Run. Once successful, a URL will appear, and you can click on it to access your application.</p>

        <h3 id="7-GG">GOOGLE CLOUD Tutorial Guide</h3>
        <p><img src="images/微信图片_20241028101034.png" alt="image" width="1000" height="560"/></p>
        <p>GCP provides rich tutorials and documentation to help users quickly get started. Users can visit GCP's 
            official website to find interactive tutorials and developer guides to learn how to use various services. 
            Here is a brief animated video I made introducing Google Cloud and how to create a simple instance. Due to 
            the removal of watermarks in the video, some areas may appear blurry. I hope this will not affect understanding.</p>
